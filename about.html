      <div class = 'columns'>
      Having directed music videos in her past work, "Roxanne" is Victoria Innocenzi's first short film.
      <br><br>
      A young woman, Roxanne (Chelsea Macleod), is blinded by her passion for a married man, Harvey (Miklos Banyai). Roxanne sits in her car outside of the fancy anniversary cocktail party her lover is throwing with his wife (Maya Rose Berko). Love-struck and desperate for his affection, she crashes the party. "Roxanne" is a study of subjectivity versus reality, as Roxanne does not perceive how her presence is not desired at the party, instead she feels as though she is the life of it due to her relationship with Harvey.
      <br><br>
      Roxanne is a shared vision and desire to capture the different ways of experience life and how much "we don't see things as they are, we see them as we are" (Anais Nin).
